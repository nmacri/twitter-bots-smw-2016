please don't diminish the user experience by just posting it as a normal video  please link them to my site
if you put a link to my site people will be able to chop & screw the video. this is a step towards the possibilities of internet based video
attention all sites just posting merely the video version of blkkk skkkn head..
blkkk skkkn head
blkkk skkkn head info
i open the debate the 2nd verse of new slaves is the best rap verse of all time.meaning  of all time in the history of rap music, period
and to who ever leaked the video  fuk you!
allow me and nick to give the world what we've been losing sleep over.
so any website that may have the unapproved / unfinished ruff. i ask you to please take it down.
the final version will be ready within the next week.
me and nick knight have been working on this video for 5 months and for creatives it's heartbreaking when something like this happens.
the blkkk skkkn hd video that leaked yesterday was not the official version.
thank you jean touitou for letting me create with you
this is not another robot movie.   guillermo del toro is a master.

my heart
loving this mood for season 4
feels good to be home
drake would come by and just help, no strings. future also came by to write. we all got new shit together that's gonna drop soon.
i wanna thank my brother drizzy for helping me on 30 hours & father stretch my hands.
season 4 begins. premire vision
my number one enemy has been my ego  there is only one throne and thats god's
in rap we have been developing a brotherhood
there is so much positive energy right now   lets stay on this ultra light beam
a wise man should be humble enough to admit when hes wrong and change his mind based on new information
some rappers got the club  some got the radio some got the consciencesome got the streets everybody has something they do the best
every rapper is somebodys favorite
that statement hast been sitting well with me thats a dated mentality   ... im not on that
man, i was thinking about when i commented on the idea of taking the rap throne
just creating in a fun simple way with no politics
imagine if the people i named went to high school 2gthr and had a project to do for school
all with one purpose of creating  beautiful product that can be attainable by everyone
a dream of mine would be to do a project where i  work side by side with raf simmons,  helmut lang, vanessa beecroft and martin margiela
stream the life of pablo on
hey nicolas ghesquiere i grew up on tron too lets be best friends!!!
id rather teachers got paid more and books cost less  #2020
we have to lower the price of textbooks
education puts americans into debt before they even get a chance to get started
steve jobs wanted to lower the cost of textbooks
shes giving everything she has to make sure her son has a better future
i mean, his mom has to work 2 days just to afford 1 book for her son
her son just got in a really good school and his textbooks are like $400 dollars each
i have a friend who works really hard and makes $370 dollars a day
all positive energy
so many people were inspired  and thats all i wanted
msg was amazing
you let me dream without limits.
they provided resources for me to create they supported me   i thank you so so much
adidas has really made all the difference
thank you adidas  for supporting my creative vision
pablo is full of joy and love because i was able to create.
i hope these words and this moment of truth can serve as some extra motivation to you
for anybody listening to pablo now, working on a dream
so people laughed when i said i wanted to be able to take care of my family
but if you dont have your paper right, there's a chance that your family can be broken up
when sway was telling me what to do, i was in debt, and had a child
when charlemagne was calling me donkey of the day i was in debt
i can see the clouds separating
im  an artist  the definition of art - or at least my definition - is to be able to see the truth and then express it...
i dont have to be cool
perhaps a fashion group will cover the 53 that ive invested over the past 13 years
perhaps adidas will do some big lebron style deal or
my dreams brought me into debt and im close to seeing the light of day
this country was built off of dreamers    never give up on your dreams, bro
you can point fingers and laugh, but for all entrepreneurs with families  ...
i wanted the world to know my struggle
money doesnt make me who i am
you cant control me or use the debt against me no more
for the past 3 years people who knew about the debt tried to use it against me in negotiations
only problem i got with good fridays is i got more songs than i got old pictures!!!! lol!!!!
also all good fridays songs will be on tidal. me and kendrick got 40 songs and me and young thug got 40 songs. 40/40 club!!!
please to all my friends fans and music lovers. sign up to tidal now.
my album will never never never be on apple. and it will never be for sale... you can only get it on tidal.
this was made with love. only god can judge me. so i only expect love back!!!
shut the fuck up and enjoy the greatness.
aight then
don't tell me lebron had a bad game. what yo jump shot look like???
the system is designed for colored people to fail and one of our only voices is music. one of our only ways out is music.
i love love love white people but you don't understand what it means to be the great grandson of ex slaves and make it this far.
to pitchfork, rolling stone, new york times, and any other white publication. please do not comment on black music anymore.
puff daddy is the most important cultural figure in my life. his influence means everything to me.
pitchfork, the album is a 30 out of 10
people wanted me to tweet again well here's some tweets!!!
and a balance art family perception friends family politics and the fucking manipulators
no matter what level you're at in life there is still a struggle
but if the self proclaimed cockiest person in the world can lay his personal business on the line then please people see my heart.
this is a god dream
i know i confuse you guys sometimes but please bare with me.
i am ultra light beaming right now. so many people have called or emailed to help today hedge fund guys billionaires etc...
i am of service to the world with my art and i just want to serve more.
and i think the idea of being a celebrity a lot of times blocks the understanding of what my purpose is.
there are people who support artist and philanthropist
i could not have done the msg without adidas but world, what i'm telling you is that was just a small sketch for what i will bring you.
also for anyone that has money they know the first rule is to use other people's money.
if i spent my money on my ideas i could not afford to take care of my family. i am in a place that so many artist end up.
but i need access to more money in order to bring more beautiful ideas to the world.
yes i am personally rich and i can buy furs and houses for my family
i want to help the world and i need help to do it. i am an artist and i care about humanity.
i just feel rich people are always too cool to ask for help trying to impress each other at dinner parties.
...on another note, can brah be the girl verson of bruh???
and yes there are misspellings on this chart thats how you know its me...
all you guys had meetings with me and no one lifted a finger to help.
i promise im going to make the world dope. all i do is make shit dope #facts
if you want to help help me
youd rather open up one school in africa like you really helped the country
all you dudes in san fran play rap music in your homes    but never help the real artists
hey larry page im down for your help too
here is my donda chart that i wrote 4 years ago that everyone laughed at
i know i can make the world a better place i have done the impossible  i retook the throne of rap i beat the fashion game
and i will always respect you for that and the world will love you
one of the coolest things you could ever do is to help me in my time of need
mark, i am publicly asking you for help
i dont have enough resources to create what i really can
im this generation's disney i want to bring dope shit to the world
world, please tweet, facetime, facebook, instagram, whatever you gotta do to get mark to support me
you love hip hop, you love my art i am your favorite artist but you watch me barely breathe and still play my album in your house
mark zuckerberg  i know its your bday but can you please call me by 2mrw
i put lowlights on my album just thinking about all the moms driving they kids to school then going to work
bars are worth more than money because it's something the people can use everyday to feel inspired.
i know y'all tired of music controlled by money and perception.  i'm proud of every dime of debt i got.
all y'all so worried about being likable but only a few are concerned about being great!!!
i am the jordan and steph curry of music, meaning i'm the best of 2 generations.
i made dark fantasy and watch the throne in one year and wasn't nominated for either ... i will have over 100 grammys before i die.
i made dark fantasy and watch the throne in one year and wasn't nominated for either ...
i'm practicing my grammy speech. i'm not going to the grammys unless they promise me the album of the year!!!
tidal is also funding a lot of my scripted content ideas.  it's a new day people.  more ultra light dreams to be realized.
man thank you so so so much everyone for signing up to tidal. tidal is now the number one app in the world!!!

ima fix wolves
after realizing he is the greatest living artist and greatest artist of all time.
mark zuckerberg invest 1 billion dollars into kanye west ideas
they are calling me to the snl stage now ... speak soon...
this is all all is fun all in good feelings... we will all be gone 100 years from now but what did we do to help while we were here!!!
i write this to you my brothers while still 53 million dollars in personal debt... please pray we overcome... this is my true heart...
let's dance in the streets. i am consumed by my purpose to help the world.
all memes are wrong... the life of paul... the life of pablo... ultralight beams... moms dads daughters sons stand up...
please forgive the profanity and give hugs and blessings to my brother kirk for standing by me... in a few hours the journey begins...
he was saved from persecution due to his roman citizenship... i have the right to speak my voice...
he was a learned man not of the original sect so he was able to take the message to the rest of the world...
paul ... the most powerful messenger of the first century... now we stand here 20 centuries later... because he was a traveler...
.... awwwwww...
bosses
thank you my brother ricardo
had to all caps this!!!!!! no more rules. make your own rules   ok now back to finishing pablo
im so hype right now    everything has changed   have yall ever seen tron? the end of the tron where everything light up!!!!
haaaaaaaaaaaaaa fuck all the haters   put your miutherfucking fist in the sky right now!!!!!!!!!!!!
and was there in full support to see me realize this dream
and im proud of this picture with me and caitlyn she gave the most heart felt speech at my wedding
ive given everything i had for this moment a lot of people feel its the paradigm shift
fashion aint no joke for me its a way of life creative expression and industry
so many people didnt make it and gave everything they had for me to stand on their shoulders and break through fashion
your site is entertaining and hilarious but certain things are just too far you have no idea what ive had to go through
im a human being im an artist, bro
you probably got bootleg yeezys on right now
but media takeout couldnt say one thing positive knowing damn well youd love to be on the yeezy 350 list
people were crying people were throwing up the fist people were dancing
i had an album listening and clothing presentation and madison square garden
respect the struggle respect the hustle respect the dreams  respect the movement
you seem like the type of organization hired to always keep dreamers down when certain things in history happen you just got to respect it
now - media takeout - always remember that you dissed the collection that changed the world.
its chance's fault the album not out yet he really wanted waves on that bitch  we in the lab now...
there would be no msg without @iamdiddy my og. he fought this war 15 years ago. respect og.
you have supported me since the beginning and i'm so happy to call you my friend!!!
the boss: thank so much anna for coming to my show!!!
the album is being mastered and will be out today added on a couple of tracks
now that the album is finally finished its back to good fridays.
i want to be the creative director of hermes
not just the famous people there    but the kids   the moms the dads  the families that came to share this moment with us
9th   it felt like a seen from the warriors     all gods   all gods all gods in the buildin
but you can see at madison square garden that you can stop us
8th   they want to control us with money and perception and mute the culture
7th  i miss that feeling  so thats what i want to help restore
thats why music is so fucking watered down right now    i miss that dmx feeling
6th  stop trying to demonize real artist     stop trying to compromise art
i cant be mad at kanye because he made me famous!  #facts
she was having dinner with one of our friends whos name i will keep out of this and she told him
5th  thing im not even gone take credit for the idea its actually something taylor came up with
4th bitch is an endearing term in hip hop  like the word nigga
3rd thing    i called taylor and had a hour long convo with her about the line and she thought it was funny and gave her blessings
2nd thing   i asked my wife  for her blessings and she was cool with it
first thing is im an artist and as an artist i will express how i feel with no censorship
i did not diss taylor swift and ive never dissed her

seems like just yesterday we were interning at fendi - now youre nominated for the lvmh young designer prize.
i am so proud of my family virgil abloh.
if you wanna have a drink with me, book a table at the spotted pig when im back in ny.
we want to innovate and we will win someday.
all we have are our dreams, and you can step on our dreams and ideas all you want, but we wont stop fighting.
fame is often looked down upon in the design world, so its actually been something i had to overcome.
because i was too famous by the time i realized i wanted to design.
i dont call myself a designer as i was not allowed to go to saint martins
i have millions of ideas and i represent a new generation just trying to express themselves in a broken world.
and i have encountered countless amounts of bigotry along the way.
to fern mallis: i just want you to understand that attempting to do clothing has been very difficult

the doors may be heavier, but i promise you we will break them.
ten years later i am still the same kid from chicago, still dreaming out loud, still banging on the door.
i wake up every day trying to give something back to you that you can rock to and be proud of.
i am honored and humbled by my fans, for the unwavering support and love over the past ten years.
gave of their heart to that project, and to all the projects that followed, and are to come.
i am extremely grateful to each and every person along that road who helped, lent an ear, lent their voice,
to not only convince my peers and the public that i could be an artist, but to actually get that art out for the world to hear.
i say finally because it was a long road, a constant struggle, and a true labor of love
ten years ago today we finally released what had been my life's work up to that point: the college dropout.

thank you, mandela, for your life's work and may it serve as a guiding light to illuminate our future.
at a young age my mother taught me the importance of his work. mandela sacrificed his life for the betterment of mankind.
i'd like to address the false stories and noise that have been engineered by the media.
despite recent media reports, i've never said anything to dishonor or trivialize the life or transition of one of the most inspiring leaders
respect to mandela, his family and his legacy.

I think what Kanye West is going to mean is something similar to what Steve Jobs means. I am undoubtedly, you know, Steve of Internet, downtown, fashion, culture. Period. By a long jump. I honestly feel that because Steve has passed, you know, it's like when Biggie passed and Jay Z was allowed to become Jay Z.
People ask me a lot about my drive. I think it comes from, like, having a sexual addiction at a really young age. Look at the drive that people have to get sex – to dress like this and get a haircut and be in the club in the freezing cold at 3 A.M., the places they go to pick up a girl. If you can focus the energy into something valuable, put that into work ethic...
Humbly, I would say I’m the most influential person in footwear right now… I’ll say, ‘truthfully.’
You mean to tell me that this girl with this f—ing body and this face is also into style, and she's a nice person, and she has her own money and is family-oriented? That's just as cool as a f—ing fighter jet or dinosaur! And just as rarely seen. (On his wife, Kim Kardashian.)
As a man I am flawed, but my music is perfect.
Bad taste is vulgar. The world as a whole is f——g ugly. And the Internet too, but I’m not in the construction business.
My greatest pain in life is that I will never be able to see myself perform live.
For me to say I wasn’t a genius, I would just be lying to you and to myself.
I don’t want to say these really big, over-the-top statements that end up getting quoted.
I am Warhol! I am the number one most impactful artist of our generation. I am Shakespeare in the flesh. Walt Disney, Nike, Google.
You know, I’m a creative genius and there’s no other way to word it.
When I think of competition it's like I try to create against the past. I think about Michelangelo and Picasso, you know, the pyramids.
50 is Eminem’s favourite rapper. I’m my favourite rapper.
I am the number one human being in music. That means any person that’s living or breathing is number two.
I’m going down as a legend, whether or not you like me or not. I am the new Jim Morrison. I am the new Kurt Cobain.
I liberate minds with my music. That's more important than liberating a few people from apartheid or whatever.
I am so credible and so influential and so relevant that I will change things.
Sometimes people write novels and they just be so wordy and so self-absorbed. I am not a fan of books. I would never want a book's autograph. I am a proud non-reader of books.
There's no fangs. I don't have fangs. I'm a porcupine. I'm a blowfish. Like, I'm a — what's the fish that blows up? I'm a blowfish. I'm not a shark, I'm a blowfish.
The media crucify me like they did Christ.
One of my biggest Achilles heels has been my ego. And if I, Kanye West, can remove my ego, I think there’s hope for everyone.
You should only believe about 90% of what I say. As a matter of fact, don’t even believe anything that I’m saying at all. I could be completely f—g with you, and the world, the entire time.
You may be talented, but you’re not Kanye West.
I’m the closest that hip-hop is getting to God. In some situations I’m like a ghetto Pope.
I’m the No. 1 living and breathing rock star.
I’m like a vessel, and God has chosen me to be the voice and the connector,

Jay is Kweli's favorite rapper, 50 is Eminem's favorite rapper, and I'm my favorite rapper.
I’m like a vessel, and God has chosen me to be the voice and the connector.
My music isn't just music -- it's medicine.
Don't ask me what I think the best song of last year was, because my opinion is the same as most of America's. It was 'Gold Digger.'
'Everything I'm not made me everything I am.' In my humble opinion, that's a prophetic statement. Gandhi would have said something like that.
Come on now! How could you be me and want to be someone else?
When I think of competition it's like I try to create against the past. I think about Michelangelo and Picasso. You know, the pyramids.
I am so credible and so influential and so relevant that I will change things.
I’m the No. 1 living and breathing rock star.
When someone comes up and says something like, ‘I am a god,’ everybody says ‘Who does he think he is?’ I just told you who I thought I was. A god. I just told you. That’s who I think I am.
For me to say I wasn’t a genius, I would just be lying to you and to myself.
I feel like a little bit, like, I’m the Braveheart of creativity.
I am Warhol! I am the number one most impactful artist of our generation. I am Shakespeare in the flesh.
Visiting my mind is like visiting the Hermès factory.
I'm doing pretty good as far as geniuses go ... I'm like a machine. I'm a robot.
I’m going down as a legend, whether or not you like me or not. I am the new Jim Morrison. I am the new Kurt Cobain.
The Bible had 20, 30, 40, 50 characters in it. You don't think that I would be one of the characters of today's modern Bible?
My greatest pain in life is that I will never be able to see myself perform live.
You can't look at a glass half full or empty if it's overflowing., Twitter,
I have, like, nuclear power, like a superhero, like Cyclops when he puts his glasses on.
Yeah. I'm rich and I'm famous, but I try not to be extra with it.
A lot of people were wondering what I was going to do if I didn't win anything. I guess we'll never know.
I'm a creative genius and there's no other way to word it.
I don't even listen to rap. My apartment is too nice to listen to rap in. 
I feel like I'm too busy writing history to read it.
Would you believe in what you believe in if you were the only one who believed it?
I am God's vessel. But my greatest pain in life is that I will never be able to see myself perform live.
I am Warhol. I am the No. 1 most impactful artist of our generation. I am Shakespeare in the flesh.
I'll say things that are serious and put them in a joke form so people can enjoy them. We laugh to keep from crying.
Nobody can tell me where I can and can't go.
I still think I am the greatest.
Man, I'm the No. 1 living and breathing rock star. I am Axl Rose; I am Jim Morrison; I am Jimi Hendrix.
I know I got angels watchin me from the other side.
I would never want a book's autograph. I am a proud non-reader of books.
I will go down as the voice of this generation, of this decade, I will be the loudest voice.
I am not a fan of books.
Sometimes people write novels and they just be so wordy and so self-absorbed.
I really appreciate the moments that I was able to win rap album of the year or whatever.
Taylor Swift beat Beyonce; at the Grammys? Beyonce be dancing in heels and shi.
I am the number one human being in music. That means any person that's living or breathing is number two.
I have to dress Kim everyday so she doesn't embarrass me.
I'm doing pretty good as far as geniuses go ... I'm like a machine. I'm a robot. You cannot offend a robot ... I'm going down as a legend, whether or not you like me or not. I am the new Jim Morrison. I am the new Kurt Cobain ... The Bible had 20, 30, 40, 50 characters in it. You don't think that I would be one of the characters of today's modern Bible?
I walk through the hotel and I walk down the street and people look at me like I'm fucking insane, like I'm Hitler. One day the light will shine through, and one day people will understand everything I ever did.
My greatest pain in life is that I will never be able to see myself perform live.
Kim doesn't understand what a blessing I am to her.
I'm like a tree. I feed the branches of the people.
Yo Taylor, I'm really happy for you, I'mma let you finish, but Beyonce has one of the best videos of all time. One of the best videos of all time!
You may be talented, but you're not Kanye West.
The media crucify me like they did Christ.
I feel like there's still niggas that owe me checks. I feel like there;s still bitches that owe me sex.
JIMMY KIMMEL IS OUT OF LINE TO TRY AND SPOOF IN ANY WAY THE FIRST PIECE OF HONEST MEDIA IN YEARS
I been waiting for a minute
For my lady
So I can't jeopardize that for one of these hoes
I been living without limits
As far as my business
I'm the only one that's in control
I been feeling all I've given
For my children
I will die for those I love
God, I'm willing
To make this my mission
Give up the women
Before I lose half of what I own
I been thinking
About my vision
Pour out my feelings
Revealing the layers to my soul
My soul
The layers to my soul
Revealing the layers to my soul
See, before I let you go
One last thing I need to let you know
You ain't never seen nothing crazier than
This nigga when he off his Lexapro
Remember that last time in Mexico
Remember that last time, the episode
Asking me why the hell I text in code
Four times that you say don't text me hoe
Told you four times, don't test me, hoe
Now we finna lose all self-control
But you ain't finna be raising your voice at me
Especially when we in the Giuseppe store
But I'mma have the last laugh in the end
Cause I'm from a tribe called check a hoe
Yeah, I'mma have to laugh Indian
Cause I'm from a tribe called check a hoe
For all my Southside niggas that know me best
I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex
Why? I made that bitch famous (God damn)
I made that bitch famous
For all the girls that got dick from Kanye West
If you see 'em in the streets give 'em Kanye's best
Why? They mad they ain't famous (God damn)
They mad they're still nameless (Talk that talk, man)
Her man in the store tryna try his best
But he just can't seem to get Kanye fresh
But we still hood famous (God damn)
Yeah we still hood famous
I be Puerto Rican day parade floatin'
That Benz Marina Del Rey coastin'
She be Puerto Rican day parade wavin'
Last month I helped her with the car payment
Young and we alive, whoo!
We never gonna die, whoo!
I just copped a jet to fly over personal debt
Put one up in the sky
The sun is in my eyes, whoo!
Woke up and felt the vibe, whoo!
No matter how hard they try, whoo!
We never gonna die
Real friends, how many of us?
How many of us, how many jealous? Real friends
It's not many of us, we smile at each other
But how many honest? Trust issues
Switched up the number, I can't be bothered
I cannot blame you for havin' an angle
I ain't got no issues, I'm just doin' my thing
Hope you're doin' your thing too
I'm a deadbeat cousin, I hate family reunions
Fuck the church up by drinkin' after communion
Spillin' free wine, now my tux is ruined
In town for a day, what the fuck we doin'?
Who your real friends? We all came from the bottom
I'm always blamin' you, but what's sad, you not the problem
Damn I forgot to call her, shit I thought it was Thursday
Why you wait a week to call my phone in the first place?
When was the last time I remembered a birthday?
When was the last time I wasn't in a hurry?

I couldn't tell you how old your daughter was
Couldn't tell you how old your son is
I got my own Jr. on the way, dawg
Plus I already got one kid
Couldn't tell you much about the fam though
I just showed up for the yams though
Maybe 15 minutes, took some pictures with your sister
Merry Christmas, then I'm finished, then it's back to business
You wanna ask some questions 'bout some real shit?
Like I ain't got enough pressure to deal with
Please don't pressure me with that bill shit
Cause everybody got 'em, that ain't children
Oh you've been nothin' but a friend to me
Niggas thinkin' I'm crazy, you defendin' me
It's funny I ain't spoke to niggas in centuries
To be honest, dawg, I ain't feelin' your energy
Money turn your kin into an enemy
Niggas ain't real as they pretend to be
How many of us? How many of us are real friends
To real friends, 'til the reel end
'Til the wheels fall off, 'til the wheels don't spin
To 3 A.M., callin'
How many real friends?
Just to ask you a question
Just to see how you was feelin'
How many?
For the last you was frontin'
I hate when a nigga text you like, "what's up, fam, hope you good"
You say, "I'm good" I'm great, the next text they ask you for somethin'
How many?
What's best for your family, immediate or extended
Any argument, the media'll extend it
I had a cousin that stole my laptop that I was fuckin' bitches on
Paid that nigga 250 thousand just to get it from him
Real friends
Huh?
Now if I fuck this model
And she just bleached her asshole
And I get bleach on my T-shirt
I'mma feel like an asshole
I was high when I met her
We was down in Tribeca
She get under your skin if you let her
She get under your skin if you-uh
I don't even want to talk about it
I don't even want to talk about it
I don't even want to say nothing
Everybody gon' say something
I'd be worried if they said nothing
Remind me where I know you from?
She looking like she owe you some
You know just what we want
I want to wake up with you in my eyes
Hey baby you forgot your Ray Bans
And my sheets still orange from your spray tan
It was more than soft porn for the K-man
She remember my Sprinter, said "I was in the grape van"
Uhm, well cutie, I like your bougie booty
Come Erykah Badu me, well, let's make a movie
Hell, you know my repertoire is like a wrestler
I show you the ropes, connect the dots
A country girl that love Hollywood
Mama used to cook red beans and rice
Now it's Denny's, 4 in the morning, spoil your appetite
Liquor pouring and niggas swarming your section with erection
Smoke in every direction, middle finger pedestrians
R&B singers and lesbians, rappers and managers
Music and iPhone cameras
This shit unanimous for you, it's damaging for you, I think
That pussy should only be holding exclusive rights to me, I mean
He flew you in this motherfucker on first class
Even went out his way so you could check in an extra bag
Now you wanna divide the yam like it equate the math?
That shit don't add up, you're making him mad as fuck
She said she came out here to find an A-list rapper
I said baby, spin that round and say the alphabet backwards
You're dealing with malpractice, don't kill a good nigga's confidence
Just cause he a nerd and you don't know what a condom is
The head still good though, the head still good though
Make me say "Nam Myoho Renge Kyo"
Make a nigga say big words and act lyrical
Make me get spiritual
Make me believe in miracles, Buddhist monks and Cap'n Crunch cereal
Lord have mercy, thou will not hurt me
Five buddies all herded up on a Thursday
Bottle service, head service, I came in first place
The opportunity, the proper top of breast and booty cheek
The pop community, I mean these bitches come with union fee
And I want two of these, moving units through consumer streets
Then my shoe released, she was kicking in gratuity
And yeah G, I was all for it
She said K Lamar, you kind of dumb to be a poet
I'mma put you on game for the lames that don't know they're a rookie
Instagram is the best way to promote some pussy
I don’t mess with Matt Lauer or the Today Show … and that’s a very nice way for me to put it! …﻿ I feel very alone very used very tortured very forced very misunderstood very hollow very very misused … I don’t trust anyone but myself!
